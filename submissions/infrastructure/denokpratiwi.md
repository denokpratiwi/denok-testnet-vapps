# vApp Proposal: HiveMind AI

## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Title:** HiveMind AI
* **Category:** infrastructure
* **GitHub Username:** [denokpratiwi]
* **Discord ID:** [1382797401223336007]

### Short Description
HiveMind AI is a decentralized protocol for collaborative AI development. By creating a tokenized marketplace for computational power and verified data, HiveMind enables a global community to collectively train, own, and govern open-source AI models. The resulting models are tokenized as NFTs, ensuring transparent provenance, shared ownership, and a new, open economy for artificial intelligence.

## 2. Problem & Solution

### Problem
The development of powerful AI is dangerously centralized. It is controlled by a handful of large corporations with proprietary data and opaque training methods. This creates significant risks, including algorithmic bias, censorship, monopolistic control over a transformative technology, and insurmountable barriers to entry for independent researchers and developers.

### Solution
HiveMind AI democratizes the creation of and access to artificial intelligence. Our protocol aligns the incentives for thousands of participants around the world to collaborate:
1.  **Data Contributors** provide high-quality, labeled datasets and are rewarded with protocol tokens.
2.  **Compute Providers** contribute their GPU/CPU cycles to the network for training and inference, earning tokens for their work.
3.  **Community Governance:** The resulting AI models are community-owned assets, represented as NFTs. Token holders can vote on everything from training priorities to model access policies, ensuring the AI develops in a way that benefits the entire ecosystem, not just a single entity.

This creates a self-sustaining loop where open innovation is rewarded, and the final product is a public good.

## 3. Technical Architecture & SL Integration

Our architecture is a hybrid system combining a robust off-chain coordination layer with a transparent on-chain settlement and ownership layer.

* **Frontend:** A web portal built with **React (Next.js)** that serves as the dashboard for all network participants: data contributors can submit and manage datasets, compute providers can monitor their nodes and earnings, and users can access the AI models.
* **Backend (Orchestration Layer):** A **Node.js** service that acts as the network's coordinator. It manages the queue of training tasks, intelligently distributes computation jobs to active nodes, verifies the integrity of completed work, and communicates with the SL blockchain to trigger reward payments.
* **Compute Client:** A lightweight, containerized application (e.g., Docker) that compute providers install on their machines. This client securely connects to the orchestration layer, receives computation tasks, executes them, and submits the results for verification.
* **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Arweave):** All datasets and final trained model weights will be stored on a decentralized storage network to ensure permanence and accessibility.

### SL Integration
The SL blockchain serves as the trust and settlement layer for the entire HiveMind economy.
1.  **Protocol Token:** A native utility token (ERC-20/SPL standard) on SL used for staking by participants, rewarding contributions, and paying for model inference fees.
2.  **Model NFT Contract:** A smart contract for minting and managing NFTs that represent ownership and version history of the trained AI models. The NFT's metadata will point to the model weights on IPFS.
3.  **Contribution & Reward Contract:** This is the core accounting contract. After the off-chain orchestration layer verifies a valid contribution (e.g., a completed training batch), it calls this smart contract to immutably record the contribution and credit the provider's account with tokens. This makes the reward system transparent and auditable.
4.  **Governance Contract:** A standard governance contract allowing token holders to create and vote on proposals related to the protocol's development and the treasury's use.

## 4. Development Timeline

Our 8-week Proof-of-Concept (PoC) will focus on proving the core economic loop of the protocol: distributing a task, verifying its completion, and rewarding the contributor on-chain.

* **Week 1-2: Protocol Design & Smart Contracts**
    * Finalize the tokenomics of the native token.
    * Develop and test the core smart contracts: the protocol token, the model NFT, and a basic version of the Contribution & Reward contract on SL.

* **Week 3-4: Backend Orchestrator & Task Management**
    * Build the initial Node.js backend service.
    * Implement a simple task queue. For the PoC, the "task" will be a standardized, verifiable computation, not a full AI training run.

* **Week 5-6: Compute Client & Contribution Flow**
    * Develop a basic version of the compute client that can connect to the backend, receive a standardized task, execute it, and submit the result.
    * Implement the verification logic on the backend to confirm the task was completed correctly.

* **Week 7-8: Frontend Dashboard & Full-Loop Integration**
    * Build a minimal frontend dashboard for a user to register as a compute provider and view their on-chain rewards.
    * Integrate all components to test the full loop: a task is sent from the backend, processed by the client, verified by the backend, and the reward is successfully recorded by the smart contract on the testnet.
